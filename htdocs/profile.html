					<h1>Profile</h1>
					
                    <p>I am a PhD student in the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge.
                    I also received my BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge in 2011.
                    I am a member of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/">Networks and Operating Systems</a>

                    My PhD was partially sponsored by <a href="http://www.laboratories.telekom.com/ipws/English">
                    Deutsche Telekom Laboratories</a>

                        <p>
                        My work in Telefonica Research included in-depth analysis of current mobile application 
                        communication patterns, their inefficiencies and the impacts they have on a 3G network as
                        well as energy consumption of the mobile device they are running on. It furthermore included
                        proposing a set of optimisations and prototyping a solution on the 
                        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/partners/#">Firefox OS</a> platform.

                        <p><strong>2011 August - 2011 September</strong></p>
                        <p>During the short period of time I took on a few projects that would later blend into
                        my PhD work. The projects were related to mobile cloud computing: cellular infrastructure
                        improvements for more efficient code offloading as well as improving machine-to-machine
                        communication efficiency through virtualization, cloud and code offloading.</p>

                        <p><strong>2010 June - 2010 August</strong></p>

                        <p>During the time I initiated the <a href="http://wwww.thinkair.net">ThinkAir</a> project and implemented
                        its core functionality. The project concerned dynamic code offloading to cloud computing facilities, based 
                        on the environmental properties and resource requirements, to improve smartphone performance and battery life.
                        It strongly reinforced my interest in mobile technologies
                        and led to starting a PhD in mobile cloud computing.</p>

                        <p>During the internship I was working on modifying a few large-scale business
                        applications, requiring to rapidly understand application logic and find the
                        best solutions for the modifications required, as well as quickly learn the

                        for experimental social psychology research. I was involved with the project from
                        the very beginning, which meant creating the core of the system that would be
                        used later, as well as determining what information about user's environment could
                        possibly be extracted and how</p>

                        <p>Having spent four years in the academy myself, I have volunteered in the organisation
                        a number of times since. I have tried to help whenever I felt like my help would really
                        be beneficial</p>

                        <p>I have given lectures on computer operating systems to the Computer Science students
                        in the academy as well as on topics related to identity development to all students.
                        I shared my views and experience with the board to help develop the academy further and 
                        most recently I helped to participate in the 
                        <a href="http://www.e-volunteering.eu/competition/">European e-volunteering competition</a>,

                        <p>In CUTEC I primarily helped with fundraising activities for the organisation's
                        entrepreneurship-related events, which involved communicating with company

                        <p>I have worked on a variety of small to medium sized web projects over the years.
                        Most of the work I have done was a rather long time ago and I barely have time for 
                        such work now. However, I do consider new opportunities if I find the projects 
                        interesting.</p>

                        <p>Since I was still in high school when I started, I had the opportunity to learn
                        valuable skills very early: communicating with clients, organising my time very well
                        and working both individually and in small, self-organised teams.</p>
